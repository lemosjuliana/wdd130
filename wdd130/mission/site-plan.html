      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <h3>Purpose</h3>
      <p>Get a new job, study, serve and start a family. As a returned missionary, have you ever felt that you have too much to do? Are you trying to find out how your new self can fit? Despite what it might look like, you are not alone. As a returned missionary myself, I know we need a lot of help, and that's what I do: I make websites that support returned missionaries through inspiring quotes, tips, and testimonies. </p>  <!-- change this -->


      <h3>Audience</h3>
      <p>My audience consists of returned missionaries in any condition, including those young adults who returned earlier from their missions. This group of latter day-saints is striving to maintain the same Spirit and progress they had during their full-time mission, or perhaps, they are trying to find out how their new self can fit. Sometimes, they may feel lost or demotivated while facing many challenges related to several responsibilities, such as getting a new job, studying, serving, and starting a family.</p>  <!-- change this -->

      <h3>My Life's Purpose</h3>
      <h4>The reason why I came to this Earth</h4>
      <p>
        "Adam fell that men might be; and men are, that they might have joy (2 Nephi 2:25). In other words, you are here on this Earth to experience true happiness. Do you remember teaching about similar principles while serving as a missionary? These principles are valid for you today, and you can always turn to God to remember why you came to this Earth.
      </p>
      <h4>Overcoming negative thoughts</h4>
      <p>
        Part of remembering your purpose includes overcoming negative thoughts. Fear is the opposite of faith, and faith is needed to persevere in the covenant path. In the Book of Mormon, we read "that there is opposition in all things" (2 Nephi 2:11), but you can always remember that opposition allows you to exercise faith and be who Heavenly Father wants you to be.
      </p>
      <h4>Reassuring my purpose</h4>
      <p>
        How did your vision expand after you returned from your mission? Perhaps you decided to change careers, seek better educational opportunities, or meet someone that can lead you to eternal marriage. All of these things are easy to recognize as part of the Lord's plan for you, but you may encounter some things that will require extra time of pondering in order to know God's will. Remember the resources you already have to guide you, such as the scriptures, your family members, church leaders, your patriarchal blessing, and close friends.

      <h3>Achieving My Goals</h3>
      <h4>Continuing to serve others</h4>
      <p>
        During your full-time mission, your goals include serving others with all your heart, might, mind, and strength (Doctrine and Covenants 59:5). Now that you are back, your goals also include your personal growth, which can be overwhelming. With so many things to do, choose today to prioritize living a life of service, even if you are feeling uncertain about your own future. Elder Dieter F. Uchtdorf shared: "[Those] who are pursuing the righteous goals of obtaining an education and finding an eternal spouse [should remember that] working diligently in the Lord’s vineyard will greatly upgrade [their] résumé and increase the probability for success in both of these worthy endeavors”  (Dieter F. Uchtdorf, “Two Principles for Any Economy,” Ensign or Liahona, Nov. 2009, 57). Despite having other responsibilities, the Lord will willingly bless you as you strive to serve those in need. 
      </p>
      <h4>Becoming self-reliant</h4>
      <p>
        Most of your goals require you to be self-reliant. This important principle was taught by the Lord since the beginning of humanity when He said: "In the sweat of thy face shalt thou eat bread (...)" (Genesis 3:19) and continues to be emphasized by modern prophets. Elder Robert D. Hales stated: "The Lord expects us to help solve our own problems. (…) We are thinking, reasoning human beings. We have the ability to identify our needs, to plan, to set goals, and to solve our problems” (Robert D. Hales, “Every Good Gift,” New Era, Aug. 1983, 8–9). Consider the areas you need to improve and seek to exercise faith, act, and be obedient to the Spirit.
      </p>
      <h4>Trusting in the Lord</h4>
      <p>
        Think about the experiences during your full-time mission that required you to demonstrate faith in the Lord. How did you feel? Did this experience help you to become a better disciple? What type of attitude did you have after these experiences. Now, you are living under the same principles of faith, hard work, and trust. Even in the most difficult challenges, choose to exercise greater faith in the Lord.
