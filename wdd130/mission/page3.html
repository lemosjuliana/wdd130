                <h2>Achieving My Goals</h2>
                <h4>Get a new job, study, serve and start a family. As a returned missionary, have you ever felt that
                    you have too much to do? Are you trying to find out how your new self can fit? Despite what it might
                    look like, you are not alone. This website supports returned missionaries in any condition. If you
                    are striving to maintain the same Spirit and progress you had during your full-time mission or
                    trying to find out how your new self can fit, our inspiring messages will help you.</h4>

                <h3>Continuing to serve others</h3>
                <p>During your full-time mission, your goals include serving others with all your heart, might, mind, and 
                    strength (Doctrine and Covenants 59:5). Now that you are back, your goals also include your personal growth, 
                    which can be overwhelming. With so many things to do, choose today to prioritize living a life of service, 
                    even if you are feeling uncertain about your own future. Elder Dieter F. Uchtdorf shared: "[Those] who 
                    are pursuing the righteous goals of obtaining an education and finding an eternal spouse [should remember that] 
                    working diligently in the Lord's vineyard will greatly upgrade [their] résumé and increase the probability 
                    for success in both of these worthy endeavors” (Dieter F. Uchtdorf, “Two Principles for Any Economy,” Ensign or Liahona, Nov. 2009, 57). 
                    Despite having other responsibilities, the Lord will willingly bless you as you strive to serve those in need.</p>

                <h3>Becoming self-reliant</h3>
                <p>Most of your goals require you to be self-reliant. This important principle was taught by the Lord since the beginning
                    of humanity when He said: "In the sweat of thy face shalt thou eat bread (...)" (Genesis 3:19) and continues to be 
                    emphasized by modern prophets. Elder Robert D. Hales stated: "The Lord expects us to help solve our own problems. 
                    (…) We are thinking, reasoning human beings. We have the ability to identify our needs, to plan, to set goals, and 
                    to solve our problems” (Robert D. Hales, “Every Good Gift,” New Era, Aug. 1983, 8–9). Consider the areas you need to 
                    improve and seek to exercise faith, act, and be obedient to the Spirit.</p>

                <h3>Trusting in the Lord</h3>
                <p>Think about the experiences during your full-time mission that required you to demonstrate faith in the Lord. How did you 
                    feel? Did this experience help you to become a better disciple? What type of attitude did you have after these experiences. 
                    Now, you are living under the same principles of faith, hard work, and trust. Even in the most difficult challenges, choose 
                    to exercise greater faith in the Lord.</p>
