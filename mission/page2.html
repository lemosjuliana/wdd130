                <h2>My Life's Purpose</h2>
                <h4>Get a new job, study, serve and start a family. As a returned missionary, have you ever felt that
                    you have too much to do? Are you trying to find out how your new self can fit? Despite what it might
                    look like, you are not alone. This website supports returned missionaries in any condition. If you
                    are striving to maintain the same Spirit and progress you had during your full-time mission or
                    trying to find out how your new self can fit, our inspiring messages will help you.</h4>

                <h3>The reason why I came to this Earth</h3>
                <p>"Adam fell that men might be; and men are, that they might have joy (2 Nephi 2:25). In other words, 
                    you are here on this Earth to experience true happiness. Do you remember teaching about similar 
                    principles while serving as a missionary? These principles are valid for you today, and you can 
                    always turn to God to remember why you came to this Earth.</p>

                <h3>Overcoming negative thoughts</h3>
                <p>Part of remembering your purpose includes overcoming negative thoughts. Fear is the opposite of faith, 
                    and faith is needed to persevere in the covenant path. In the Book of Mormon, we read "that there is 
                    opposition in all things" (2 Nephi 2:11), but you can always remember that opposition allows you to 
                    exercise faith and be who Heavenly Father wants you to be.</p>

                <h3>Reassuring my purpose</h3>
                <p>How did your vision expand after you returned from your mission? Perhaps you decided to change careers, seek better 
                    educational opportunities, or meet someone that can lead you to eternal marriage. All of these things are easy to 
                    recognize as part of the Lord's plan for you, but you may encounter some things that will require extra time of pondering 
                    in order to know God's will. Remember the resources you already have to guide you, such as the scriptures, your family members, 
                    church leaders, your patriarchal blessing, and close friends.</p>
