      Hello! My name is Juliana, and I am from Brazil. Since I was a kid, I have been interested in arts, design, photography, and filmmaking, which is probably why I love to learn anything related to Web Development. My dad is my biggest inspiration: he always encouraged me to pursue higher education and follow a promising career path.

      I love to spend time with my family. My parents met the missionaries before I was born, and I also had the chance to serve as a full-time missionary in my own country. I seek to apply what I learned during that precious time here in my online study. What I like most about BUY-Idaho is the opportunity to grow, learn and teach each week. I know that by taking this course I will have better employment opportunities and enough background to learn other design and programming concepts.

      I am also very excited to meet you all!
