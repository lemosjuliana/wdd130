      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <h3>Purpose</h3>
      <p>Get a new job, study, serve and start a family. As a returned missionary, have you ever felt that you have too much to do? Are you trying to find out how your new self can fit? Despite what it might look like, you are not alone. As a returned missionary myself, I know we need a lot of help, and that's what I do: I make websites that support returned missionaries through inspiring quotes, tips, and testimonies. </p>  <!-- change this -->


      <h3>Audience</h3>
      <p>My audience consists of returned missionaries in any condition, including those young adults who returned earlier from their missions. This group of latter day-saints is striving to maintain the same Spirit and progress they had during their full-time mission, or perhaps, they are trying to find out how their new self can fit. Sometimes, they may feel lost or demotivated while facing many challenges related to several responsibilities, such as getting a new job, studying, serving, and starting a family.</p>  <!-- change this -->
